I'm building PeopleRate after getting burned by a freelancer who had ZERO online reputation.

Problem: You can review restaurants, hotels, products... but not the people you work with.

Solution: Anonymous, verified reviews for professionals.

What's different:
✅ NLP-powered search (type naturally)
✅ Anonymous reviewers (privacy-first)
✅ Balanced reviews (not just complaints)
✅ Multi-platform verification

Try it: [link]
We're giving first 100 users a "Founding Member" badge!

Questions? AMA! 🚀"

"After getting burned by a 'senior developer' who ghosted after taking payment, 
I built PeopleRate - basically TrustPilot for people.

You can:
• Search anyone by typing naturally ("John Smith software engineer Seattle")
• Read anonymous reviews from real clients/colleagues
• See verified social media profiles

Not trying to sell anything - genuinely curious if this solves a real problem.

I built PeopleRate after a bad freelancer experience. You can review businesses on 
Yelp/TrustPilot, but there's no reputation system for individual professionals.

What it does:
• Natural language search (no exact name needed)
• Anonymous reviews (privacy-first)
• Multi-platform verification (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
• Profile claiming (own your reputation)

Tech stack: Python/FastAPI, MongoDB, NLP parsing

Privacy considerations:
• Reviewers stay anonymous
• No personal data exposed
• People can claim profiles to respond

Try it: [link]
Code: [GitHub repo]

Would love feedback on privacy/moderation approach.

Relevant HN discussion: [link to old thread about reputation systems]"
```

### 4. **Indie Hackers Launch**

• MongoDB backend
• 0 marketing budget

Launch channels trying:

Ask me anything! Especially about privacy/moderation."

## 🎪 Phase 3: Viral Growth Tactics (Week 4-12)

### **Goal:** 10,000 users through viral loops

### 1. **Profile Claiming Virality** ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
**How it works:**
1. User A creates profile for User B (reviews them)
2. User B gets email: "Someone reviewed you on PeopleRate"
3. User B clicks to see review → must sign up to claim profile
4. User B invites colleagues to build reputation
5. **Viral Loop:** Each claim = 3-5 new users

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: "John Smith reviewed you on PeopleRate"

Hey Sarah,

Someone who worked with you left a review on PeopleRate (think TrustPilot for professionals).

Review preview:
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Excellent communication..."

Want to see the full review and respond?

👉 Claim Your Profile: [link]

Why claim your profile:
✓ See all reviews about you
✓ Respond publicly or privately

### 5. **LinkedIn Organic Strategy** (FREE Traffic)

#### **Post Schedule (3x/week):**
**Monday:** Controversial Take
```
"Unpopular opinion: LinkedIn recommendations are useless.

Here's why:
• Only 2% are negative (everyone's amazing!)
• Written by friends (biased)
• No verification
• Generic "John is great to work with"

The truth? You need ANONYMOUS feedback to see the real story.

That's why we built PeopleRate - TrustPilot for professionals.

Agree or disagree? 👇"
```

**Wednesday:** Story/Case Study
```
"Sarah hired a 'senior designer' with 50 LinkedIn recommendations.

3 weeks later:
• Missed every deadline
• Poor communication
• Submitted stock templates
• Demanded payment upfront

The recommendations? All fake.

We built PeopleRate to solve this.

Anonymous reviews from REAL clients.

Have you been burned by fake credentials? 💬"
```

**Friday:** Value Post (Tips/Insights)
```
"5 questions to ask before hiring ANYONE:

1. "Can I see reviews from past clients?" (not testimonials)
2. "Who was your most difficult client and how did you handle it?"
3. "What's your typical response time?"
4. "Can you share a project that didn't go well?"
5. "May I contact a reference anonymously?"

Bonus tip: Check their PeopleRate profile 😉

What questions do YOU ask? 👇"
```

### 6. **Twitter/X Viral Strategy**

#### **Thread Topics (3x/week):**
**Viral Hook Template:**
```
"🚨 Thread: Red flags I ignored before losing $10K to a freelancer

(so you don't make the same mistake)

🧵👇"

Try it: [link]"
```

### **Unique Selling Points (USPs)**
1. ✅ **Revolutionary NLP Search** - "Find anyone by typing naturally"
2. ✅ **Privacy-First Anonymous Reviews** - "Your voice, not your identity"
3. ✅ **Balanced Review System** - "Positive + negative feedback" (not just complaints)
4. ✅ **Multi-Platform Verification** - "LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram - we verify it all"
5. ✅ **Profile Claiming** - "Own your reputation"

### **Target Audience**
**Primary:** Freelancers, consultants, contractors (age 25-45)  
**Secondary:** Small business owners, hiring managers  
**Tertiary:** Job seekers, professionals building reputation

## 🔥 Phase 0: Build in Public Launch (Week 1 - PRIORITY #1)

### **Goal:** Establish public presence + start documenting journey

### **Platforms to Launch:**
**Primary:** Twitter/X (@PeopleRate or @YourHandle)  
**Secondary:** LinkedIn (Your personal profile)  
**Tertiary:** Indie Hackers, Reddit (r/buildinpublic)

### **Day 1: First "Build in Public" Posts**

```
🚀 Starting today: Building @PeopleRate in public

The problem: Lost $5K to a "senior developer" with zero online reputation

The solution: TrustPilot for professionals - check anyone's reputation before hiring

My commitment: I'll share EVERYTHING publicly
✅ Daily user count (starting at 0)
✅ Every win and failure
✅ Revenue numbers (when they exist)
✅ Code decisions and pivots
✅ Marketing tactics that work (and flop)

Day 0 Stats:
• Users: 0
• Revenue: $0
• Lines of code: 2,000+
• Belief this will work: 100%

Goal: 0 → 10,000 users in 90 days

#### **LinkedIn Post:**
```
🚀 Building PeopleRate in Public - Day 1

Three weeks ago, I lost $5,000 to a "senior developer" who:
• Had glowing LinkedIn recommendations (all fake)
• Promised 10 years experience (couldn't deliver)
• Ghosted after taking 50% upfront

The worst part? I had no way to check his REAL reputation.

So I built PeopleRate - think TrustPilot, but for professionals.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Starting today, I'm building in public. Here's what I'll share:

✅ Daily metrics (users, reviews, growth)
✅ Every mistake and lesson learned
✅ Revenue when it happens
✅ Growth tactics that work (and fail)
✅ Product decisions and pivots

Why share everything? Transparency builds trust. And trust is everything for a reputation platform.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Day 0 Stats:
📊 Users: 0
💰 Revenue: $0
💻 Tech: FastAPI, MongoDB, 2000+ lines of code

🧵 Launching @PeopleRate on Product Hunt in 3 days

I'm nervous. Here's why:

1/ This is the moment where months of work get judged in 24 hours

2/ I've never done this before. What if no one cares?

3/ What if I get roasted for privacy concerns?

But here's what I'm doing to prepare:
[Continue thread with preparation steps]

First Comment:
"Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm building PeopleRate after getting burned by a freelancer who had ZERO online reputation.

Problem: You can review restaurants, hotels, products... but not the people you work with.

Solution: Anonymous, verified reviews for professionals.

What's different:
✅ NLP-powered search (type naturally)
✅ Anonymous reviewers (privacy-first)
✅ Balanced reviews (not just complaints)
✅ Multi-platform verification

Try it: [link]
We're giving first 100 users a "Founding Member" badge!

Questions? AMA! 🚀"
```

### 2. **Reddit Strategy** (Targeted Communities)

- r/Entrepreneur (3M+ members)
- r/smallbusiness (1M+ members)

**Reddit Post Template:**
```
Title: "Built a site to check someone's reputation before hiring them [side project]"

"After getting burned by a 'senior developer' who ghosted after taking payment, 
I built PeopleRate - basically TrustPilot for people.

You can:
• Search anyone by typing naturally ("John Smith software engineer Seattle")
• Read anonymous reviews from real clients/colleagues
• See verified social media profiles
• Submit reviews (completely anonymous)

Not trying to sell anything - genuinely curious if this solves a real problem.

Feedback welcome! Especially on privacy concerns."
```

### 3. **Hacker News Launch**

"Hi HN!

I built PeopleRate after a bad freelancer experience. You can review businesses on 
Yelp/TrustPilot, but there's no reputation system for individual professionals.

What it does:
• Natural language search (no exact name needed)
• Anonymous reviews (privacy-first)
• Multi-platform verification (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
• Profile claiming (own your reputation)

Tech stack: Python/FastAPI, MongoDB, NLP parsing

Privacy considerations:
• Reviewers stay anonymous
• No personal data exposed
• People can claim profiles to respond

Try it: [link]
Code: [GitHub repo]

Would love feedback on privacy/moderation approach.

Relevant HN discussion: [link to old thread about reputation systems]"
```

### 4. **Indie Hackers Launch**

Backstory: Lost $5K to a freelancer with no online reputation. Built this to help 
others avoid the same mistake.

Stats so far:
• 2 months building

• Viral profile claiming feature

Ask me anything! Especially about privacy/moderation."
```

## 🎪 Phase 3: Viral Growth Tactics (Week 4-12)

### **Goal:** 10,000 users through viral loops + consistent build in public updates

**Build in Public Integration:** Share every growth experiment publicly - wins AND failures

### 0. **Daily Build in Public Updates** ⭐ FOUNDATION FOR ALL GROWTH

**Non-Negotiable Daily Routine:**
```
Every morning (9 AM):
1. Post yesterday's metrics on Twitter
2. Share one lesson learned
3. Preview today's experiments
4. Engage with 10 other founders

Example:
"Day 23 of @PeopleRate:
• 487 users (+34)
• 12 claims yesterday

Trying new tactic today: Cold DM to freelancers
Expectation: 5% response rate
Reality: Will report back tonight 😅

#buildinpublic"
```

### 1. **Profile Claiming Virality** ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY (Share results publicly)
**How it works:**
1. User A creates profile for User B (reviews them)
2. User B gets email: "Someone reviewed you on PeopleRate"
3. User B clicks to see review → must sign up to claim profile
4. User B invites colleagues to build reputation
5. **Viral Loop:** Each claim = 3-5 new users

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: "John Smith reviewed you on PeopleRate"

Hey Sarah,

Someone who worked with you left a review on PeopleRate (think TrustPilot for professionals).

Review preview:
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Excellent communication..."

Want to see the full review and respond?

</a>
```

### 5. **LinkedIn Organic Strategy** (FREE Traffic)

#### **Post Schedule (3x/week):**
**Monday:** Controversial Take
```
"Unpopular opinion: LinkedIn recommendations are useless.

Here's why:
• Only 2% are negative (everyone's amazing!)
• Written by friends (biased)
• No verification
• Generic "John is great to work with"

The truth? You need ANONYMOUS feedback to see the real story.

That's why we built PeopleRate - TrustPilot for professionals.

Agree or disagree? 👇"
```

**Wednesday:** Story/Case Study
```
"Sarah hired a 'senior designer' with 50 LinkedIn recommendations.

3 weeks later:
• Missed every deadline
• Poor communication
• Submitted stock templates
• Demanded payment upfront

The recommendations? All fake.

We built PeopleRate to solve this.

Anonymous reviews from REAL clients.

Have you been burned by fake credentials? 💬"
```

**Friday:** Value Post (Tips/Insights)
```
"5 questions to ask before hiring ANYONE:

1. "Can I see reviews from past clients?" (not testimonials)
2. "Who was your most difficult client and how did you handle it?"
3. "What's your typical response time?"
4. "Can you share a project that didn't go well?"
5. "May I contact a reference anonymously?"

Bonus tip: Check their PeopleRate profile 😉

What questions do YOU ask? 👇"
```

### 6. **Twitter/X Viral Strategy**

#### **Thread Topics (3x/week):**
**Viral Hook Template:**
```
"🚨 Thread: Red flags I ignored before losing $10K to a freelancer

(so you don't make the same mistake)

🧵👇"

[10 tweets with specific red flags + solutions]

"That's why I built @PeopleRate - check anyone's reputation before hiring.

Try it: [link]"
```

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Reply to every comment within 1 hour
- Ask questions to boost engagement

## 🎯 Success Formula

```
Build in Public Growth = (Daily Posts × Authenticity × Engagement) + Viral Loops

Where:
- Daily Posts = Consistent updates (Goal: 30/month minimum)
- Authenticity = Real metrics + honest failures (not just wins)
- Engagement = Response rate to comments (Goal: 100% within 1 hour)
- Viral Loops = Profile Claims × Share Rate × Review Quality

Example Path to 10K Users:
Month 1: 500 followers × 10% try product × 2x viral coefficient = 1,000 users
Month 2: 2,000 followers × 10% try product × 2x viral coefficient = 4,000 users  
Month 3: 5,000 followers × 10% try product × 2x viral coefficient = 10,000 users
```

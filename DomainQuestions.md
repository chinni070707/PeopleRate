I understand you want to create PeopleRate, a people review platform similar to TrustPilot but for individuals. This is an interesting concept! Let me ask some clarifying questions to better understand the requirements before we start development:

## Core Functionality Questions:

1. **User Authentication & Profiles:**
   - Do users need email verification during registration?
   - Should users be able to have public profiles themselves (showing their own reviews received)?
   - Any social login options (Google, LinkedIn, etc.)?

2. **Review System:**
   - Star rating scale (1-5 stars)?
   - Should there be categories for reviews (e.g., Professional, Personal, Service-related)?
   - Any moderation system for inappropriate reviews?
   - Can users respond to reviews about them?

3. **Person Profiles (Being Reviewed):**
   - What information should be stored for each person being reviewed?
   - Should people being reviewed need to claim/verify their profiles?
   - How do you handle privacy concerns and consent?

4. **Search Functionality:**
   - Priority order for search results when multiple people have the same name?
   - Should search be public or require login?
   - Any verification system for phone numbers, company affiliations, etc.?

5. **Technical Preferences:**
   - Frontend framework preference (React, Vue, Angular, or plain HTML/CSS/JS)?
   - Backend preference (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)?
   - Database preference (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)?
   - Do you want to start with a simple prototype or build a full-featured application?

6. **Legal/Privacy Considerations:**
   - How will you handle GDPR compliance and user privacy?
   - Terms of service for what constitutes appropriate reviews?

Please let me know your thoughts on these points, and we can create a development plan that matches your vision!
